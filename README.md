# Hi, I'm Stylianos 👋 

### M.Eng Civil Engineer (NTUA Graduate) & CS Student at Maastricht University (2nd degree)
**Bridging the gap between Physical Infrastructure and Artificial Intelligence.**

I am a **National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)** graduate with a 5-year Integrated Master’s (M.Eng.) in Civil Engineering, specializing in **Transportation Engineering**. My transition into Computer Science was driven by a fascination with how data-driven intelligence can transform physical systems.

### From Physics to Algorithms
As a **Research Associate at NTUA**, I worked on high-impact transportation projects utilizing Machine Learning and Data Science to solve real-world mobility challenges. This experience shifted my focus: I realized that to build the future of **Physical AI**, I needed to master the **science of computing**—not just the application of tools.

I am currently pursuing my **second degree (B.Sc. in Computer Science)** at Maastricht University to build a world-class foundation in software engineering, algorithms, and systems architecture.

### The Hybrid Advantage
I bring a "Dual-Stack" perspective to technical challenges:
* **Engineering Domain Expertise:** 5 years of rigorous training from NTUA. I understand the "ground truth" of physical systems, traffic dynamics, and engineering constraints.
* **Research Experience:** Proven track record in academia—handling complex datasets, technical reporting, and research-led development.
* **CS Foundations:** Currently deep-diving into Data Structures, Discrete Mathematics, and Computer Architecture to complement my existing programming and embedded systems skills.
